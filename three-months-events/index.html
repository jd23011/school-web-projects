    <p>
        In WW2 the Soviet Union invaded finaland it was called the Winter War or Talvisota. <br> 
        Finland lost some land but did better than expected. <br>
        Later Finland declared war on the Soviet Union to retake their land this was called the Continutation War. <br>
        Finland didnt lose any land however they didn't take any either. <br>
        However on the 23rd of June this year at exactly 12:43pm Finland started the Second Continuation War. <br>

    <h2>Fun fact:</h2>
    <p>
        There are two ways to have new lines in text files <br> 
        carrige return line feed (CRLF) and line feed (LF) <br> 
        windows uses CRLF while linux and many other <br>
        operating systems use LF this doesnt usually <br> 
        cause problems however it can cause problems <br>
        with software that isnt designed to handle <br>
        both file types.
