<img class="centerImage sizeImage" src="imgs/2025_0406_20285000.jpg" alt="image of a tree during blue hour">
<p class="text1">
    I took this picture at 8:28pm (20:28) on April 6, 2025 on a Fujifilm X-T3 camera with a ISO of 640, a shutter speed of 1/2 second, and an f-stop of f/2.8. <br> 
    It is a picture of a tree during blue hour which is the time shortly after sunset where the sky appears dark blue. <br> 
    This effect can be taken advantage of in photography to create interesting images by changing color settings in the camera.</p>

    Although this isn't so much a hobby more an interest it's one of the only things I could come up with. <br>
    My interest cycle over the course of a year but this is one of my current ones. <br>
    The image shown is a picture of Union Pacific 4014. <br>
    4014 is a 4-8-8-4 locomotive meaning it has 4 leading and trailing wheels as well as 2 sets of 8 driving wheels. <br>
    The wheels are articulated to allow the massive locomotive to go around turns more easily. <br>
    4014 and other locomotives of it's type were used in the Wasatch Grade. <br>
    It was made to replace the 4-6-6-4 Challenger type locomotives also used in the Wasatch Grade. <br>
    A replacement was needed as Challengers would require the help of an aditional locomotive along a certain part of the track. <br>

    You may have been under the impression that Linux is an operating system made to do stuff, <br> 
    however you are actually incorrect it is a hobby that requires you to spend an absurd amount of time fixing the smallest of problems.
